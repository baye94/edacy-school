# Launching an Angular Edaci School Project

This guide explains how to launch an Angular project created as part of your Edaci School training.

## Getting started using

## Getting started developing

1. Ensure you have the following installed in your system:

    [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

    [`npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. Install [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally.
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

3. Clone the project locally into your system.
```
git clone https://github.com/baye94/edacy-school.git
```

4. `cd` into project root directory and make sure you are on the master branch.

5. Install the dependencies.
```
npm install
```

6. To preview the app, run the following command and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
```
ng serve
```

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the
[Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
